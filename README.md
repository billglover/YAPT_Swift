# YAPT - Yet Another Pomodoro Timer #

> This is a re-write of my original YAPT application. I'm re-writing it to pick up the basics of Swift.

Use this simple timer to help break up your day into small blocks of uninterrupted work. Get interrupted before the timer rings then you must abort the timer and start again. You'd be surprised at how many times you are interrupted or distracted.

The timer is basic, but deliberately so. More features are in the works but I want to ensure these don't distract your from the task in hand.

This App is in no-way affiliated with The Pomodoro TechniqueÂ® developed by Francesco Cirillo. For more on the technique (which doesn't require the use of any App at all), please visit the [official site](http://pomodorotechnique.com/)
